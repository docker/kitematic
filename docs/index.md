# Kitematic 

Kitematic, the Docker GUI, runs on Mac OS X and Windows operating systems. Beginning with the 1.8 Docker release, you use the Docker Toolbox to install Kitematic.  See the [Mac OS X installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac) or the [Windows installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/installation/windows) for details on installing with Docker Toolbox.
