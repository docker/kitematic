# Managing Volumes


### Default Volume Directories

Every container created through Kitematic automatically has its volumes exposed on your Mac, which means you can manage files in volumes via the Finder. Kitematic exposes a container's volume data under `~/Kitematic/<container's name>/`. Quick access to this folder (or directory) is available via the app:

### Changing Volume Directories

Let's say you have an Nginx webserver running via Kitematic (using the `kitematic/hello-world-nginx` image on DockerHub). However, you don't want to use the default directory created for the website_files volume. Instead, you already have the HTML, Javascript, and CSS for your website under `~/workspace/website`. Kitematic makes it easy to change the container's volume to read from this directory instead of the default one created by Kitematic:
