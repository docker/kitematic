# Kitematic: Known Issues


Kitematic is in beta, so we're still working out the kinks. The most common
errors occur at the setup stage since creating a VM reliably with VirtualBox can
be tricky. We are working on this problem.

In the meantime, below are a list of common errors and solutions that work for
most people.

## Setup Error or Hanging at 99%

Sometimes Kitematic doesn't set up VirtualBox properly. Retrying the setup
usually works (via one of the two retry buttons). If not, try the following
commands on the command line:

- `docker-machine rm -f dev`
- `docker-machine create -d virtualbox dev`

Then re-open Kitematic. This usually fixes the issue, but if it persists, feel
free to view our <a href="https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug">existing GitHub
issues</a>.

## Contributing Fixes

We're always looking for help to make Kitematic better and more reliable! Visit
[our GitHub page](https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic) for docs on how to
contribute.

Under the hood, Kitematic uses [Docker
Machine](https://github.com/docker/machine) to provision Docker-enabled VMs via
VirtualBox. We're still working on a stronger integration with this project.
Their [GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker/machine) is a great place to start
if you're looking to help fix specific issues around VM provisioning.
