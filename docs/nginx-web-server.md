# Serving a Static Website with Nginx

In this tutorial, you will:

- Download and run a web server container
- Explore the container's website data natively on your Mac
- Use volumes to modify the website data

In this example website we'll be serving the popular 2048 game, as shown below. Let's get to it!

#### Running the Nginx Web Server Container

First, if you haven't yet done so, [download and start Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/download) . Once installed and running, the app should look like this:

![Nginx create](/assets/nginx-create.png)

Click on the _Create_ button of the `hello-world-nginx` listing as shown above. This will download and run a tiny Nginx web server in a container via Kitematic, allowing you to serve website data on your Mac.

Once it's done downloading you should see a quick preview of the example website that comes with the container, as shown below. Click on the preview to see the result in your own browser.

**What just happened?** Kitematic downloaded the `kitematic/hello-world-nginx` image from the Docker Hub and then created and ran a Docker Nginx container from this image.

#### Viewing the Website Data in Finder

This container exposes website data via a _Docker volume_. Kitematic makes managing Docker volumes easy - you can edit the data in Finder or with your favorite text editor. By default, Kitematic places volumes under `~/Kitematic` but you can change this in the container settings. To access the files via finder, click on the in-app folder icon for a container:

![Nginx data volume](/assets/nginx-data-volume.png)

A Finder window of the folder should open containing the index.html file we see being served by the container.

#### Serving Your Own Website Data

Now let's try serving a more interesting website. [Download the zipped files](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048/archive/master.zip) for 2048, a popular (and addictive) web-based tile game. Extract this zip file into the folder you just opened:

![Website files for 2048](/assets/nginx-2048-files.png)

Switch back to Kitematic and restart the container by clicking the "Restart" button as shown below. Your Nginx container should now be serving 2048.

**What just happened?**
Kitematic automatically reveals Docker container volumes via directories on your Mac. In this case you changed the container's volume data via the Finder to serve a website we downloaded.
