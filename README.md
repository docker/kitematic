Please give us feedback on the new [Docker Desktop Dashboard](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/edge-release-notes/)!

In the latest Edge release of Docker Desktop we have introduced the new [Docker Desktop Dashboard](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/edge-release-notes/). As part of this, Docker is working on providing a common user experience to developers and bringing the best Kitematic features to its Desktop customers. 

As a result, we plan on achieving feature parity and archiving the Docker Kitematic Project during 2020. After we archive the Kitematic Project there will be no new releases of Kitematic.

## Archive FAQ

**Why are you archiving Kitematic?**
We are learning from  the capabilities in Kitematic and incorporating them into a common developer User experience and benefit all Docker Desktop users.

**When will this happen?**
Once we have reached feature parity and provided the most important capabilities from the existing Kitematic UI. We aim to achieve this and then to archive Kitematic in 2020. 

**What can I do if the new UI doesn't support something I need?**
Tell us! Please add requests on the Kitematic repo. We need you to tell us what features you use so we can bring them across into the new UI.  We are very interested in your feedback starting with the Edge release.
